# GitHub Action to Publish Unit Test Results

This [GitHub Action](https://github.com/actions) analyses Unit Test result files and
publishes the results on GitHub. It supports the JUnit XML file format.

Unit test results are published in the GitHub Actions section of the respective commit:

***Note:** This action does not fail if unit tests failed. The action that executed the unit tests should*
fail on test failure.

A comment is posted on the pull request page of that commit, if one exists:

The checks section of the pull request also lists a short summary (here `1 fail, 1 skipped, 17 pass in 12s`),
and a link to the GitHub Actions section (here `Details`):

The result distinguishes between tests and runs. In some situations, tests run multiple times,
e.g. in different environments or setups. Displaying the number of runs allows spotting unexpected
changes in the number of runs as well.

The symbols have the following meaning:

|symbol|meaning|
|:----:|-------|
|![‚úî](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2714.png)|A successful test or run|
|![üí§](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a4.png)|A skipped test or run|
|![‚úñ](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2716.png)|A failed test or run|
|![üî•](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f525.png)|An erroneous test or run|
|![‚è±](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/23f1.png)|The duration of all tests or runs|

When this action has been run on master, or earlier commits in the same branch, then this action
also compares unit test results across commits. This allows seeing changes in the number of tests and runs introduced by a given commit or pull request:

## Using this action

You can add this action to your GitHub workflow and configure it as follows:

```yaml
- name: Publish Unit Test Results
  uses: EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@master
  with:
    check_name: Unit Test Results
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    files: test-results/**/*.xml
    log_level: DEBUG
```

**Note:** This action can only be used on `push` events.

The job name in the GitHub Actions section that provides the test results can be configured via the
`check_name` variable. It is optional and defaults to `"Unit Test Results"`, as shown in above screenshot.

Files can be selected with wildcards like `*`, `**`, `?` and `[]`. The `**` wildcard matches [directories recursively](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob): `./`, `./*/`, `./*/*/`, etc.

The `log_level` variable is also optional. The default value is `INFO`. The Python logging module defines the [available log levels](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels).
